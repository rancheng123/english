The cake French people cook on a spit
Thought to have been brought to France by Napoleonic soldiers retreating from battle in Eastern Europe, gateau à la broche, or cake
on a spit, has become a Hautes-Pyrénées tradition.

Take a valley in southern France’s Hautes-Pyrénées region, add a group of friends who’ve known each other since they were kids, and
mix in a tradition dating back at least 200 years, and you get the small village of Arreau – where time turns at the speed of a cake
on a spit.

Made by pouring layers of batter on a rotating conical-shaped mould over an open fire, the cake on a spit, called le gâteau à la broche
in French, is a typical Eastern European recipe. But according to legend, when Napoleon's soldiers were withdrawing from their invasion ' +
'of Russia in 1812, they brought it back with them to France. There, the recipe had been transmitted orally, with no written record of' +
'the original version. Although the cake is considered rare, according to Slow Food, the tradition is alive and well in two French regions: ' +
'Hautes-Pyrénées and Aveyron.
In Arreau, our welcome was as warm as the fire used to cook the cake. While we walked around the village, stopping from time to time for
    a glass of wine, Joseph Loste, President of the Confrérie du Gâteau à la Broche (the Brotherhood of the Cake on a Spit), and his
childhood friends Paul-J, Lou-Lou, Malou, Christiane and Enrique, took us into the heart of the tradition, telling us about the cake’s
history and showing us the secret to making it.

Formed more than 20 years ago, the Brotherhood is not only a way to keep the recipe and the tradition alive, but it also nourishes
friendships that trace back at least 50 years.
    According Loste, as kids, he and his friends had a crucial role in making the cake. During holidays or after school, while their
    parents were at work, they would help their grandparents prepare the dessert for big family reunions, putting the fresh dough on the
spit and turning it in front of the fireplace. When pieces of dough fell into a big cooking pot placed below, the children would be rewarded
for their work in the form of hot, half-cooked sweet dough.
    Today, this group of friends still enjoys making the cake, and all the nostalgia that goes with it.
    The day after visiting Arreau, we all woke up at 6am to go to Morlaàs, some 90km to the west, where the Salon du Vin et de la
Gastronomie, a traditional food and wine fair, was taking place. There, Loste and the rest of the Brotherhood demonstrated how to make
the cake, which takes five hours to complete.

Throughout the day, they alternated slowly pouring layers of dough on the mould and turning the spit. As the cake cooked, the centrifugal
force of the spinning motion caused the dough to spread from the centre of the mould, creating a peak that resembled a stalagmite with
    rocky protrusions.

(serves 120 people)
Ingredients:
    120 eggs
3kg sugar
3kg flour
3kg butter
2 litres rum
2 cups Ricard

While the fire is being prepared, mix the egg yolks with half the sugar. Add the rum and Ricard, and then fold in the flour. Stir in the
melted butter. Separately, beat the egg whites, adding the remaining sugar once soft peaks form. Continue beating until they look like
‘snow’, and then combine with the yolk-sugar mixture until a deep yellow dough is formed.

    Cover the big, conical-shaped wooden mould with baking paper and place it on a spit in front of the fire, turning it constantly. After
about an hour, begin gently pouring the dough on it. Continue adding the dough and turning the spit for about five hours.
    People gathered, drawn in by the smell of the cake cooking – particularly the rum – and waited to get a taste of the finished cake,
    which had turned an inviting sunny-yellow colour. After the cake was placed on a table to be sliced, Enrique, a spirited 60-year-old,
    took Malou’s hand, and they danced together in front of the fireplace to celebrate the end of an amazing day.
