Known for breeding tough leaders like ex-Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson but also comedians like
Billy Connolly, this city may have a steely exterior but it's soft at heart.
Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, eclipsing the country’s capital, Edinburgh. Straddling the banks
of the River Clyde, in its industrial heyday it was the world’s shipbuilding yard but following decimation
of its heavy industries, the city has spent the last 30 years reinventing itself.
    Today Glasgow is a leading example of “how cities can change their economies,” according to Scott Taylor,
    chief executive of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau.
    These days, beyond its 32,000-strong workforce in the tourist industry, Glasgow is a hub for low-carbon
    technology expertise. SSE, the UK’s biggest producer of renewable electricity, has its European
green-energy HQ here, and Iberdrola/ScottishPower its global base for working on offshore wind-farm
facilities. Other industries well represented in Glasgow include life sciences, with companies such as
Life Technologies Corp, BioOutsource and SB Drug Discovery, and engineering, with global names such asBAE
Systems and Thales Optronics.
    Glasgow has also become a popular destination for Europe’s conference organisers, winning 3,323
international and domestic conferences and adding £1.2 billion to the local economy in the last decade,
    Taylor said. Key venues include the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre with its distinctive
armadillo-shaped Clyde Auditorium and five exhibition halls, and the University of Strathclyde’s new
    state-of-the-art Technology and Innovation Centre.
    Mercer’s 2014 Cost of Living Survey ranks Glasgow as one of the least expensive cities in the world
to visit. Locals — known as Weegies or Glaswegians — are also fiercely proud of being hailed as the
“friendliest city in the world” by Conde Nast Traveller magazine and travel publisher Rough Guides.
    Cultural know-how
People bond over humour as much as over food.
    In a city that appreciates plain-speaking, openness is valued. “In Glasgow it’s less about the occasion
and more about the ability to connect and to have a social relationship. It can be over drinks or lunch or
dinner. The important thing is that you’re able to bond,” said Steven Mail, a Jacksonville, Florida-based
investor in digital and social media companies whose global travels bring him regularly to Glasgow. “The
dry Scottish humour is part of that. People bond over humour as much as over food.”
In meetings, be prepared for everyone pitching in with ideas. “There’s less of a hierarchy and less
pretentiousness,” said Mail. “In some parts of the world I would wear an expensive watch to meetings but
in Glasgow that’s not necessary. People aren’t trying to impress the other person. They’re trying to
connect, to find a solution and a way of doing business together.”
Airport
Scotland’s main long-haul airport, Glasgow International is 8 miles (13km) west of the city. It offers
flights to around 110 destinations worldwide, including Canada, the US and the Middle East. A new direct
route to Halifax in Nova Scotia has just launched and direct links to Munich and Prague will run from
June onwards.
    Step outside the main terminal and you’ll find taxis and shuttle buses, 24 hours a day. A cab ride to
the city centre with Glasgow Airport Taxis takes around 20 minutes and costs about £23 ($35). Shuttle busses
are a cheaper option. The Service 500 shuttle runs up to every 10 minutes, taking about 25 minutes into the
city centre and costs £6.50 ($10).
    The second airport is Glasgow Prestwick, 32 miles (51km) southwest of the city, serving European
destinations. It’s the main base for budget airline Ryanair. Cabs cost £50 to £60 ($76 to $91) into
downtown and take around 40 minutes. The airport also has its own train station with up to three trains
an hour into Glasgow Central mainline station, taking 50 minutes and costing £7.80 ($12).
    From Glasgow Central, Manchester is 3 hours 20 minutes away by train and London about four and a
half hours.
    Money matters
Scottish bank notes have the same value as Bank of England notes and are legal currency throughout the UK.
    However, since they have different designs, they are sometimes refused outside Scotland and when changing
abroad. The best plan is to swap your Scottish bank notes for English ones before leaving.
    Hotels
A few steps from Glasgow Central railway station, the five-star Radisson Blu is an airy contemporary hotel
with concierge service, valet parking, express laundry, high-speed internet, access to a swimming pool and
sauna. The entire first floor is dedicated to meetings and events, including audio-visual equipment and
private-function bars. Downstairs, the soaring atrium area with bar-lounge service is a useful drop-in
rendezvous.
    Planted on Finnieston Quay, two minutes’ walk from the SECC, the recently refurbished Hilton Garden
Inn is a four-star establishment offering rooms from £68/night ($104), with free wi-fi, in-room Apple
computer, fitness centre and river views.
    Dinner for one
    For Scottish fish and seafood, paired with French wines, go to Rogano, a few steps from the stunning
Gallery of Modern Art and the fashion boutiques on Buchanan Street. With its authentic art deco interior,
    this restaurant and oyster bar offers the elegant flair of a Clyde-built luxury liner of the 1930s.
    Meals are also served in the bar where you can eavesdrop on the gossip of the local media, legal,
    business and showbiz crowd.
    More chat, and if you’re lucky — live traditional music at the open fireside — are on the menu at
Babbity Bowster. Housed within an eighteenth-century building in the Merchant City, music sessions are
scheduled twice weekly in this lively bar, but also tend to happen spontaneously. A three-course meal in
the first-floor restaurant, including Scottish fare such as haggis, costs from £22.50 ($35).
    Off the clock
To explore Glasgow’s shipbuilding heritage, visit Riverside Museum on the banks of the Clyde. Beneath the
zigzag roof of this Zaha Hadid-designed museum you’ll also find a fascinating roundup of twentieth-century
transport, from trams, trolley buses and locomotives to vintage cars, buses and motor bikes. Moored outside
is The Tall Ship, the last Clyde-built sailing ship still afloat.
    To immerse yourself in the art nouveau world of Charles Rennie Mackintosh, join a freeguided tour of the
Mackintosh House within the Hunterian Art Gallery.The furniture and interiors have been re-assembled exactly
as the Glasgow-born architect, designer and artist decreed for his own home between 1906 and 1914. The Willow
Tea Rooms are one of the most popular stops on the Mackintosh Trail.
    Special considerations
When you’re out and about, don’t be offended if you’re addressed as ‘pal’ — whether you’re male or
female — and bombarded with direct questions. Glaswegians really love to chat and aren’t known for being
    shy.
