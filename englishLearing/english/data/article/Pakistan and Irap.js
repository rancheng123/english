Iraqi forces have repelled counter-attacks by so-called Islamic State (IS) as they push the
group into a corner of Mosul's Old City.
IS deployed large numbers of suicide bombers in different parts of the northern city but the
affected areas were quickly brought under control, Iraqi officials say.
    The Iraqi offensive to remove IS from the city is in its final phase.
    The operation to retake Mosul, seized by IS in 2014, began last October.
    The government announced the liberation of the eastern half in January 2017, but the west
of the city, with its narrow streets, has proved more difficult.
    Nevertheless, IS is now confined to 2.5 sq km (a square mile) of territory.
    Iraqi forces were just 600 metres away from accomplishing their mission, police commander
Lt General Raed Jawdat said.
    At least two IS counter-attacks were reported on Sunday night. The Baghdad-based Kurdish
Shafaq news agency reported three attacks by the group in western Mosul - in al-Tanak, Rajm
Hadid and al-Yarmouk districts.
    Residents' houses were set on fire, the agency said.

What is clear is that these are the dying days of IS in Mosul.
    There has been a strong uptick in the Iraqi government offensive in recent days.
    There were 20 air strikes on Sunday, with helicopter gunships pounding IS targets and a great
deal of mortar fire. Counter-attacks by IS involving suicide bombers were dealt with swiftly.
    IS fighters are pinned down in a corner of the Old City. It was expected that the last few
yards of this conflict would be the hardest in an area where battle-hardened, largely foreign
jihadis have dug in with defences including tunnels.
    One soldier from the forces we have been filming with said they had faced 80 suicide bombers
in four days.
    Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to remain trapped in the Old City.
    The increasing pressure on IS comes less than a week after the group blew up the city's ' +
'al-Nuri mosque and its landmark crooked minaret.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the destruction of the mosque, which was more than 800
years old, was "an official declaration of defeat" by IS.
    The mosque was the scene of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's only public appearance, ' +
'when he demanded allegiance to his "caliphate" in July 2014.
The secret lives of IS fighters
The offensive against IS in Mosul, the group's biggest and last urban stronghold in Iraq, ' +
'was launched on 17 October 2016.
Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and
Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, have been deployed.

I was just a couple of streets away from one of the IS counter-attacks.
    We had about 20 bodies (Iraqi soldiers) here yesterday and many more injured. In fact
the trauma stabilisation point (TSP) is full of soldiers right now. A brigadier arrived with
    a bullet in his neck yesterday afternoon and it was shortly after that everything went a bit crazy.
    There were cars set alight and roads were closed.
    According to sources here, about 20 jihadists escaped from the Old City and popped up a
couple of blocks from our TSP. In addition to this, the jihadist snipers have night vision
goggles which meant the Iraqi army could only move very slowly.
    It's definitely calmed down a bit now, although between about five and seven this morning ' +
'it was pretty full on.

At least 123 people were killed when a lorry transporting oil burst into flames near the Pakistani
city of Ahmedpur East, local officials say.
    A crowd had gathered reportedly to collect fuel leaking from the overturned vehicle when it
caught fire. Dozens are being treated in hospital.
    It appears the tanker blew a tyre while rounding a sharp bend in the road.
    The subsequent fire may have been sparked by someone lighting a cigarette, rescue services say.
    The country's roads are notoriously dangerous, with poor vehicle maintenance and reckless ' +
'driving contributing to the problem.

Army helicopters were dispatched to ferry casualties to hospitals, army spokesman Major Gen Asif
Ghafoor said in a tweet.

Pakistani media have published pictures from the scene, showing charred bodies and vehicles.
    There are fears that the death toll could rise further.
    At least six cars and 12 motorcycles were burnt, Pakistan's Dawn newspaper reports.
Some victims may only be identified by DNA sampling as bodies were badly burned in the incident,
    reports say.
'Police appeals ignored'
Police sources told Pakistani government news agency APP that the tanker had been carrying 25,000
litres (5,500 gallons) of oil and had been travelling from Karachi to Lahore.

It slipped off a road and overturned in the Kachi Pul area, they said, about 8km (five miles)
from Ahmedpur East, in Punjab's Bahawalpur district.
"People living in roadside villages, carrying domestic pots rushed to the scene to collect oil " +
"and they also made phone calls to their relatives living in other" +
" villages to immediately come to collect oil," the sources said.

Traffic police had tried in vain to keep the crowd away from the tanker as people, including women
and children, continued collecting oil in pots, the sources said.
"Suddenly, [a] huge fire erupted in the oil tanker which engulfed all people standing around the " +
"vehicle," the police sources added.
"According to the initial reports, somebody tried to light a cigarette," igniting spilt fuel, Jam
Sajjad Hussain, spokesman for the rescue workers service, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.
    Emergency services struggled to find burn units to treat the injured, APP says.
    Ahmedpur Sharqia Health Center and Bahawal Victoria Hospital have no such units but some
casualties were brought to Nishtar hospital in Multan and others were being moved to hospitals
in the city of Bahawalpur, about 50km away.
