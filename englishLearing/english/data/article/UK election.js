Election 2017: What now for your finances?

    Kevin Peachey
Personal finance reporter
Posted at 17:54
Pound notes
PA
Now the voting is over, it is time for a new kind of count - a calculation of what a hung parliament means for your finances.

    Uncertainty abounds yet, even in its infancy, we know that the government - whoever forms it and however it operates - will make changes that will have a significant impact on your finances.

    This will have permutations for pay, decisions determining the length of our working lives and, of course, a new relationship with the European Union that will affect our financial outlook as a nation and individually.

    So, what might change and when?

Views around the UK: Julie in Stockton South

BBC Radio 5 live

Julie Bell at work at a café in Thornaby
Fiona Trott
All day today, BBC Radio 5 live's reporters are hearing your stories from around the country.

Julie Bell is at work this morning at a café in Thornaby. Her husband is a retired steel worker. In her constituency of Stockton South, Labour have taken the seat from the Conservatives.

    She told reporter Fiona Trott she believed the Labour win was down to the younger voters."There's a lot of young people I work with, who work in this café here, who voted Labour," she said.

    Julie has been a Labour voter all her life and voted Labour this time, but she did consider voting Conservative.

"I was in two minds about Theresa May because I do believe she's the stronger one, but I voted Labour because I'm working class and I think Labour are for us, and I think Theresa May's for the rich people, not the down-to earth people."

Conservative MP Evans: Campaign was an absolute disaster
Posted at 17:53
Conservative MP Nigel Evans has said his party's election campaign was an "absolute disaster" but that Theresa May should remain as prime minister.

Mr Evans told the BBC he supported a coalition deal between the Conservatives and the Democratic Unionists (DUP) in order to begin the Brexit talks.

    But Mr Evans said his party had derailed its own campaign and its manifesto "had steered it straight towards the iceberg", with the proposals on social care doing the most damage.

    There were, he said, "big questions" about the "bear traps" in the manifesto and whether the plans should have been shown to "older and wiser Cabinet members" before it was announced.

    He said: "We hijacked our own campaign and from then on it was an absolute disaster."

McDonnell: Election has made Brexit ‘a bit of a mess’

BBC Radio 5 live
Posted at 17:51

Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the country is “in a bit of a mess at the moment” over Brexit, after the general election resulted in a hung parliament.

    McDonnell, who retained his seat in Hayes & Harlington, said Labour were prepared to form a minority government following result and that they would seek to “change the tone” on Brexit.

“The style of negotiations isn’t the one where you bang the table and throw tantrums in the way that we’ve seen from Theresa May – you seek to secure what is in the mutual interest," he said.

Political arithmetic - Can Tories or Labour get the support they need?
    Posted at 17:51
The BBC's political research unit has been looking at the projected results and doing the arithmetic to work out whether the Conservatives or Labour could get enough votes to get their laws passed.

If the projections are correct, the Conservatives would have enough support in parliament if they secured the backing of the DUP:

    Conservatives: 319
DUP: 10
Total: 329 seats

But a progressive alliance behind Labour would fall short:

    Labour: 261
SNP: 35
Liberal Democrats: 12
PC: 4
Green: 1
Total: 313

Result 'bad but not fatal', says Pickles
Posted at 17:48
Sir Eric Pickles, who stood down as a Conservative MP at this election, said it had not been "the happiest campaign" he'd been involved in.

What we've got to do now is put a majority together to remain in government. There will be a time for us to go through what went wrong and how we can improve, but it's not now.
    When the BBC's Andrew Neil suggested the Conservatives were "the walking wounded", and Theresa May "a lame duck", Sir Eric replied:

I feel you're rubbing it in. It's not a happy moment for the Conservative party, but it's not necessarily a fatal moment.

Standing down as UKIP leader, Paul Nuttall said he was "confident" his party had a "great future" as the "guard dogs of Brexit".

He resigns with immediate effect, meaning Pete Whittle, London Assembly member is now acting leader.

May 'facing Brexit pressures'
Posted at 17:43
Dr Matthew Mokhefi-Ashton, politics specialist at Nottingham Trent University, says both wings of the Conservative party will see Theresa May as "weak and vulnerable".

“The only thing that might save her in the short-term is that any potential successor would be thrown headfirst into the complex Brexit negotiation," he says.

"They'd suffer the same problem she did as not having a personal mandate from the country. Given how her gamble turned out, they might not be eager to follow her down that path.

“We can also expect to see Conservative pro-Remain MPs who have felt ignored and bullied over the last year to suddenly start to flex their muscles."

Morgan: 'Not the result we wanted'
Posted at 17:37
Nicky Morgan
BBC
Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan says "this is not the result any of us wanted when the prime minister called the election" - but she thinks Theresa May should still lead the Conservative party.

    She said she "really feels" for colleagues who have lost their seats.

    While the result "will make life difficult", she says of Mrs May:

    Theresa May is a competent, and more than capable, prime minister to lead the party. But clearly, there has been a misjudgement.
    She admits "there will be discussion within the Conservative party, obviously, about the campaign".

Abbott result 'best response' to critics
Posted at 17:36
Diane Abbott's "landslide" in Hackney North and Stoke Newington, where she increased her majority by 12.2% to poll 42,265 votes - three-quarters of the electorate - was "the best response to her critics", according to the Independent's Josh Withey.

    Ms Abbott was temporarily replaced as shadow home secretary on the eve of the election, with Labour saying she was unwell. She had been criticised after getting her figures wrong in radio interviews during the campaign.

    Withey writes: "Despite the barrage of negativity from the other side of the aisle, and a torrent of vile sexist and racist abuse on Twitter, Ms Abbott can hold her head high once again after returning a stupendous victory."

The north London MP tweeted that she was "humbled to receive an increased majority of over 35,000 in Hackney North & Stoke Newington".

FTSE 100 up 45 points
Mixed response from investors
Posted at 17:34
Mid-morning on the London share market, the FTSE 100 index is up by 45 points or 0.6% at 7495.

A lot of the companies that make up that index have operations overseas, so the weaker pound - down 1.7% after this morning's results - provides a boost to their profits reported in sterling.

The wider FTSE 250 which contains more UK-focused firms is down 172 points or 0.8% at 19,571.

Small business leaders call for delay to Brexit negotiations
Posted at 17:30
The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has released a statement calling for political stability and a delay to the beginning of Brexit talks.

    Its national chairman, Mike Cherry,said: “In the coming hours and days, business needs immediate reassurance from the government that emerges about how it will protect the economy from any political turmoil.

"The UK must be seen to remain open for business, with a government committed to supporting enterprise."

But he said Brexit negotiations should be led by a government and a prime minister "that will be in place for the duration". So he said the FSB was calling for a delay to the start of the talks, due to start in 11 days' time.

Mood in EU 'not one of glee' - Sophie in 't Veld

MEP Sophie in 't Veld, who is deputy to Guy Verhofstad, lead Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, says the mood in the EU today is "not one of glee" rather one of concern.

She says Brexit poses huge challenges to both the UK and EU and talks should begin as soon as possible.

    However, she bristles at reports that Theresa May is concerned the EU might try to delay Brexit talks, saying that it is the Conservatives who have delayed negotiations by calling this election.

"This is not a time for political posturing. We have big challenges that we have to face so everybody has to take their responsibility."

'Messy situation' for DUP
    BBC Northern Ireland Political Correspondent Gareth Gordon writes...
Posted at 17:24
The DUP is meeting now to reflect on a situation that one party source described as "messy".

    The source confirms soundings have been made but nothing formal has been agreed.

    Talk of agreement is described as "premature" and the party is expected to have a news conference in the early afternoon.
