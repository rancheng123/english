But while tensions on the Korean peninsula ensured the election was closely watched internationally, for South Koreans the priority has been corruption and the economy, with youth unemployment stubbornly high.
    Mr Moon has vowed to address these problems through reforms, including ensuring a level playing field for smaller businesses.
